TODO:

Write a web scraping script using a language and library of your choice (e.g., Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy).

- Task 1.1: Set up the development environment and install the required libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, requests). (Estimate: 30 minutes)
- Task 1.2: Write a function to send an HTTP GET request to the target URL and retrieve the HTML content. (Estimate: 30 minutes)
- Task 1.3: Write a function to parse the HTML content and extract the desired data. (Estimate: 1-2 hours, depending on the complexity of the HTML structure)
- Task 1.4: Write a function to save the extracted data to a file or data structure for further processing. (Estimate: 30 minutes)
  
In the script, define the URLs you want to scrape and the data you want to extract from your website.

- Task 2.1: Identify the specific URLs to be scraped and list them in the script. (Estimate: 15 minutes)
- Task 2.2: Define the data points to be extracted from each URL (e.g., product names, prices, descriptions) and specify how they can be identified in the HTML (e.g., by tag, class, or ID). (Estimate: 30 minutes)
  
Implement error handling and logging to handle potential issues during scraping.

- Task 3.1: Implement try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the HTTP request or HTML parsing process. (Estimate: 30 minutes)
- Task 3.2: Implement logging to record important events, such as successful data extraction, errors, and exceptions. (Estimate: 30 minutes)
- Task 3.3: Add appropriate error messages and status codes to provide meaningful feedback in case of errors. (Estimate: 15 minutes)

Test the script locally to ensure that it works as expected.

- Task 4.1: Run the script on a set of test URLs to verify that the data extraction process works as expected. (Estimate: 30 minutes)
- Task 4.2: Review the extracted data to ensure that it is accurate and complete. (Estimate: 15 minutes)
- Task 4.3: Test the error handling and logging mechanisms by intentionally introducing errors (e.g., invalid URLs) and verifying that the script handles them gracefully. (Estimate: 30 minutes)


Annoying thing about web scraping that comes up every single time I look it up:

1. "Oh no don't scrape my website"

How about this? Shut the fuck up. Imagine posting a flyer and then guarding it from anyone taking a picture of it.

Absolutely asinine. I will share my tricks to help others take pictures of your stupid shit as much as I can.
