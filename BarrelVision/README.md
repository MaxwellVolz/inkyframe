## Scope of the Project

The goal of BarrelVision is to create a simple and reliable way for surfers to track the waves and tides in their favorite spots. The project uses a Raspberry Pi and an InkyFrame display to provide a low-powered, always-on display that shows current wave and tide conditions. *The project can be easily customized to display data from a variety of sources, including online tide and wave data APIs...maybe.*

## Installation and Setup

To install and set up BarrelVision, you will need a Raspberry Pi, an InkyFrame display, and a few other components. You can find detailed instructions for setting up the project in the [BarrelVision documentation - Coming Soon!](#).

## Usage

Once you have set up BarrelVision, you can use it to track the waves and tides in your favorite surf spots. The project is designed to be always on, so you can easily check the conditions at any time.

## Contributing
